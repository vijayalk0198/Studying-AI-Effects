# Quantitative Study of Impact of AI on Customer Care and Brand Loyalty Among Millennials and Gen Z in London

## Introduction
This quantitative study explores how AI-driven customer service affects brand perception and loyalty among Millennials (25-34) and Gen Z (18-24) in London. The research focuses on four objectives: evaluating customer satisfaction with AI agents, the role of perceived empathy during service encounters, AI’s impact on brand perception and loyalty, and generational differences in AI affinity and emotional engagement.

## Data Overview
Data was collected through an online SurveyMonkey questionnaire distributed among London university students. The survey covered AI interaction experience, perceived AI qualities (seamlessness, problem-solving, empathy), brand perception, loyalty intentions, and demographics, providing comprehensive insights into AI’s customer service impact.

## Tools and Concepts
Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data validation and preprocessing  
- **SPSS**: Statistical analysis  
- **SurveyMonkey**: Data collection

**Concepts Exposure**

Key concepts include regression analysis, ANOVA, correlation, and t-tests. These statistical methods ensure a rigorous assessment of relationships between AI experiences, brand perception, and customer loyalty.

## Methodoogy
A quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was implemented for this study. Independent and dependent variables were identified from the collected data, with relevant variables selected for each hypothesis to perform appropriate statistical tests. Data collected via SurveyMonkey was initially loaded and explored in Excel to ensure validity and check for any necessary cleaning or preprocessing. Once prepared, the data was loaded into SPSS, where each statistical test was conducted.
To analyze the data, methods such as regression analysis, ANOVA, correlation, and t-tests were employed. These statistical techniques are foundational in marketing research, providing robust tools for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## Results  
- **H1**: Understanding capability significantly affects AI satisfaction (**R² = 0.301**, **β = 0.281**, **p = 0.033**).  
- **H2**: Empathy correlates with AI satisfaction (**rs = 0.415**, **p < 0.001**).  
- **H3**: Empathy is the strongest satisfaction predictor (**R² = 0.346**, **B = 0.177**, **p = 0.045**).  
- **H4**: AI satisfaction predicts brand perception change (**R² = 0.204**, **p < 0.001**).  
- **H5**: Human agents do not significantly enhance loyalty (**ANOVA: p = 0.002**).  
- **H6**: AI efficiency strongly affects brand perception (**R² = 0.290**, **p < 0.001**).  
- **H7 & H8**: No significant generational differences in AI interaction frequency or brand loyalty.  

The study underscores AI’s efficiency in customer service while emphasizing the critical role of empathy in enhancing satisfaction and brand loyalty.  

## Learnings  
1. **Data Collection Challenges**: Encouraging participants to complete a 12–14-minute survey was difficult. Motivating respondents and ensuring completion requires effort and persistence.  
2. **Platform Selection**: Choosing an appropriate survey platform, like SurveyMonkey, is essential for smooth data collection and analysis.  
3. **Conceptualizing Metrics**: Understanding and framing metrics in a form suitable for analysis is key to obtaining meaningful insights.  
4. **Choosing the Right Test**: Selecting the correct statistical test for each hypothesis improves the study’s reliability and overall quality.
